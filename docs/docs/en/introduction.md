# Introduction

This project builds upon the foundation of Kademlia. Kademlia is a distributed hash table that enables millions of computers to self-organize into a network, communicate with each other, and share resources.

Several approaches and ideas proposed by Kademlia are utilized in this project, serving as the basis to expand the functionalities of the system, while others are employed in a similar manner as Kademlia.

Once the file system is established, it is integrated with AutoGOAL to tackle machine learning problems in a more efficient manner in terms of performance, network utilization, and storage.
