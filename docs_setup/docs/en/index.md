# Introduction

This project uses Kademlia as its starting point. Kademlia is a distributed hash table that enables millions of computers to automatically organize themselves into a network, communicate with other computers in the network, and share resources.

Several approaches and ideas proposed by Kademlia are used as a foundation to expand the functionalities of the project, while others are used in the same way as Kademlia.

Once a file system is in place, it is integrated with AutoGOAL to efficiently solve machine learning problems in terms of performance, network usage, and storage.
